drupal-cookbook
===============

This is a Drupal chef cookbook designed to work with (https://github.com/willieseabrook/druploy "Druploy")

There are a number of Drupal cookbooks already available, but they tend not to work very well with standard Drupal agency workflow.

This Drupal Chef Cookbook doesn't do anything with regards to installing Drupal (as it assumes a normal agency workflow of everything coming out of custom git repos)

All it does is configure a LAMP server with optimal settings for Drupal
